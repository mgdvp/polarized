## Quick start
1) Install dependencies
```powershell
npm install
```

2) Create environment variables (already added if you used the in-editor action).
Create a file named `.env` in the project root with your Firebase client config:
```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```
Note: `.env` is already in `.gitignore`.

3) Run the dev server
```powershell
npm run dev
```
Open the printed local URL in your browser.

## Firebase setup
- Auth providers:
  - Email/Password: enabled
  - Google: enabled (optional)
- Firestore: start in test mode during development
- Storage: start in test mode during development

Suggested minimal development rules (tighten for production):
```jsonc
// Firestore (Rules snippets ‚Äì adapt for production)
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{uid} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == uid;
    }

    match /posts/{postId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.resource.data.authorUid == request.auth.uid;

      match /likes/{uid} {
        allow read: if true;
        allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == uid;
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```jsonc
// Storage (Rules snippets ‚Äì adapt for production)
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /posts/{uid}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == uid;
    }
  }
}
```

## Project structure (selected)
- `src/App.jsx` ‚Äì routes, auth state wiring
- `src/firebase.js` ‚Äì initializes Firebase using `.env` (VITE_ vars)
- `src/components/`
  - `Login.jsx`, `SignUp.jsx` ‚Äì auth screens (email verification handled)
  - `Header.jsx` ‚Äì app header
  - `Profile.jsx` ‚Äì profile card, edit name, logout, user-specific feed
  - `CreatePost.jsx` ‚Äì image upload + caption (client compression)
  - `PostsFeed.jsx` ‚Äì responsive grid feed with likes and skeletons
- `src/utils/image.js` ‚Äì Canvas compression helper
- `src/utils/firebaseErrors.js` ‚Äì maps common Auth errors to friendly text
- `src/style.css` and `src/styles/*.css` ‚Äì global + component styles

## How posts are stored
Collection: `posts`
```json
{
  "postedAt": <serverTimestamp>,
  "imageUrl": "https://...",
  "caption": "string (<= 100 chars)",
  "author": "username",
  "authorUid": "uid",
  "authorPp": "photoURL",
  "likeCount": 0
}
```
Per-user likes:
- Subcollection: `posts/{postId}/likes/{uid}` with `{ uid, createdAt }` (for idempotency)

## Notes & troubleshooting
- Email verification: Email/password users must verify before they can continue; unverified sessions are treated as logged out.
- Profile feed: We support legacy posts without `authorUid` by also filtering by `author` (username) when viewing profiles.
- Grid images: We reserve space with a 3:4 wrapper and `object-fit: contain` to avoid layout shift and cropping.
- Env changes: If you change `.env`, restart the dev server for Vite to pick them up.
